# Chapter 5 questions  
## 1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?  
It provides text description of the image if you cannot see it.  
## 2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?  
If the image is placed before a block level element then that element will appear on a new line after the images. If the image is places inside a block level element, text and other elements will flow around the image.  
## 3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?

## 2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?  
It is an image that is used in several different parts of the interface. When a sprite is used, it means the browser only has to request one image rather than many which improves page loading time.
