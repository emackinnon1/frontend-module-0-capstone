        <ul class="hobby-list">
          drawing
          soccer
          stick n poke tattooing (I charge in beers)

      <h2>Beginning Calisthenics</h2>
      <p>I think the one hobby that I have stuck with the longest and been the most consistently passionate about is health and fitness.  I love it. I would
      play sports and be active all day if I could. I love setting fitness goals and breaking them, and seeing how far I can push myself mentally and physically.<br />

      I used to run 5 or more miles every day (mostly from the cops, obviously). (insert running from cop pic)<br />

      On my off days I played soccer, my other love.  They were my drugs, my stress relievers and a permanent
      (or so I thought) part of my lifestyle.<br />

      Just before I turned 27, disaster hit.  I had my 4th knee surgery. Afterwards, the doctor told me I couldn't run anymore and I would need a
      total knee replacement in 10 years at the latest (if I was lucky) but most likely a bit earlier. I had no cartilage left and grade 4 (it only goes up to grade 5) arthritis.
      I was absolutely devastated.<br />
