1. HTML provides structure and basic content to a website.  
2. The terms are used interchangeably but strictly speaking the element encompasses the opening tag, the content following it and the closing tag, while tags are just the previously-mentioned opening and closing tags.  
3. Attributes provide more information about the element in the form of a name and an associated value.  
4. The <body> tag is the main part of the page and what shows up in your browser. The <head> element contains information about the page like the title of the page. The contents of the title are shown in the top of the browser and can give you an idea of what the page contains.  
5. Right click on the webpage or element you'd like to look at and on the subsequent menu, click "Inspect".  
6. <h1> is for main headings.  
<b> indicates bold text.  
<blockquote> is used for long quotes that take up a whole paragraph.  
<br /> is the line break tag and is used to show a line break in the middle of a paragraph.  
<strong> elements indicates that this element's content has strong importance.  
7. Empty elements usually have only one tag that contains a slash before the closing angle bracket.  
8. Semantic markup elements do not affect the structure of your web page, but they provide extra information to search engines and screen readers.  
9. <nav> contains the navigational blocks for the site, such as the links at the bottom of every webpage.  
<aside> can contain information that is related to an article but not essential to it.  It can also act as a container for information that is related to the whole page.  
<header> contains the header of the entire page or the header of individual articles on the page.
