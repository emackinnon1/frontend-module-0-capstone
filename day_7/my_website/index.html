      <p>It is hard to pick just one thing I am passionate about.  I am always finding new stuff to get excited about learning and doing.
        I have a some pretty random of hobbies and interests, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="hobby-list">
          drawing
          soccer
          stick n poke tattooing (I charge in beers)
          hiking
          photography
          astrophotography
          building terrariums
          collecting carnivorous plants
          traveling
          learning German

      <h2>Where it all started</h2>
        <p>I think the one hobby that I have stuck with the longest and been the most consistently passionate about is health and fitness.  I love it. I would
        play sports and be active all day if I could. I love setting fitness goals and breaking them, and seeing how far I can push myself mentally and physically.<br />

        I used to run 5 or more miles every day (mostly from the cops, obviously). (insert running from cop pic)<br />

        On my off days I played soccer, my other love.  They were my drugs, my stress relievers and a permanent (or so I thought) part of my lifestyle.<br />

        Just before I turned 27, disaster hit.  I had my 4th knee surgery. Afterwards, the doctor told me I couldn't run anymore and I would need a
        total knee replacement in 10 years at the latest (if I was lucky) but most likely a bit earlier. I had no cartilage left and grade 4 (it only goes up to grade 5) arthritis.
        I was absolutely devastated. It's amazing how much of your personal identity and wellbeing is derived from physical activity. Something you take for granted about your body can
        just be gone one day.<br />

        (insert crying pic)
        What this whole series of life events did for me was make me realize how fluid a healthy lifestyle can be. I thought of myself as a runner and
        figured that would be a life-long moniker. It forced me to reevaluate my fitness goals and how to achieve them.<br />

      <div class="discovery">
        <p>A few weeks after my surgery, I switched to cycling for cardio and bought a bike. Over the years I had started weight training, but did it purely supplementally and didn't really set many goals
          besides "Putting on muscle mass". So I continued weight training, but I was bored. Also during this time, I moved to Germany where calisthenics is much more popular.
          I found all these outdoor workout spots around the city and saw people were doing pullups, pushups and dips, etc.<br />

          And then I saw this one guy doing handstand pushups. I had never seen that before. "Woah. I'm learning that. I don't care how long it takes me," I thought to myself. Commence the endless Google
          searches and hours spend watching YouTube videos on handstands and workout programs to achieve them.<br />

          I put a rudimentary program together and starting working on it every day.  As I did all this research, I found other exercises and things that I wanted to learn.  Calisthenics
          is full of awesome-looking exercises and skills to learn! After a few months of hard work, I could do this:<br />

          (first v-sit to HS)

          It was sloppy, but it was my first real progress!!  I was thrilled. More importantly, I was hooked. I found my new drug.<br />

          Since then, I have learned a lot more. Through hours of research and many trials and errors, I have learned the ins and outs of building a program specifically tailored for
          bodyweight fitness, learned how to prevent and recover from injuries, how to be systematic in my approach to it (you can't just go up in dumbbell weight to make the
          exercise harder, you have to change body your position), and a lot more.  I began training my friends or giving advice to the ones who were interested in it, too. I even
          gave a talk and demo on it for my work! The main thing I learned, though, was more skills:<br />

          <p>
            I have so many more achievments to unlock in this sport. It seems like every time I learn something new, I barely give myself time to feel accomplished before I start working towards
            the next skill.  Just to give an idea, these are just a few of the things I want to learn:<br />
