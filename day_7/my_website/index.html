        While I have interest in all of the above and more, I think the one interest and passion of mine that I have stuck with the longest
        and been the most consistent about is health and fitness.  I absolutely love it. I would
        play sports and be active all day if I could. I love setting fitness goals and breaking them, and seeing how far I can push myself mentally and physically.
        I was, up until a few years back, an endurance sport guy and never thought I was built for real strength building.  That pencil-necked
        sucker to the right is me before getting into calisthenics.  I used to accidentally poke people in the eye with that Adam's apple.

        This current exercise fixation,  calisthenics, has other slightly different offshoots known as bodyweight fitness or street workouts. It is has a lot of great benefits,
        like the fact that you can do it anywhere!  You don't need a gym because there is minimal equipment involved.  It involves a lot of crossover ideas and techniques from gymnastics with less of an
        emphasis on aesthetics and more of an emphasis on strength building and hypertrophy.  It involves a lot of compound exercises that recruit multiple muscle groups,
        resulting in more calories burned.  However, there are cons as well, like it being harder to measure progress (precisely how much harder is a one arm push up than a regular
        pushup?), but overall it is a really great fitness journey to embark on.</span>

        I used to run 5 or more miles every day. <br /><br />
        On my off days I played soccer, my other love.  They were my drugs, my stress relievers and a permanent (or so I thought) part of my lifestyle.<br />

        Just before I turned 27, disaster hit.  I had my 4th knee surgery. Afterwards, the doctor told me I couldn't run anymore and I would need a
        total knee replacement in 10 years at the latest (if I was lucky) but most likely a bit earlier. I had no cartilage left and grade 4 (it only goes up to grade 5) arthritis.
        I was absolutely devastated. It's amazing how much of your personal identity and wellbeing is derived from physical activity. Something you take for granted about your body can
        just be gone one day. It was eye-opening.<br />

        <p>A few weeks after my surgery, I switched to cycling for cardio and bought a bike. Now, a few years after I started getting serious about running,
          I actually did start weight training but did it purely because my legs were fairly big from running and soccer, and
          my upperbody looked like a PVC pipe. So I didn't really set many goals
          besides "putting on muscle mass" and "getting stronger" (pretty generic stuff). So while recovering from my knee surgery,
          I continued my weight training with the same vague goals, but I was bored. Also during this time, I moved to Germany
          where, unbeknownst to me at the time, calisthenics is much more popular.
          I found all these outdoor workout spots around the Munich and saw people doing pullups, pushups and dips, etc. I liked the idea of exercising outside, so I began to frequent
          these outdoor gyms.</p>

          And then, one day, I saw this one guy doing handstand pushups. *record scratch*

          I don't care how long it takes me," I thought to myself. Commence the endless Google searches and hours spend watching YouTube videos on handstands and workout programs to achieve them.
          I put a rudimentary routine together and starting working on it every other day.  As I did all this research, I found other exercises and things that I wanted to learn.  Calisthenics
          is full of awesome-looking exercises and skills to work towards! <br>

        Since then, I have learned a lot more. Through hours of research and many trials and errors, I have learned the ins and outs of building a program specifically tailored for
        bodyweight fitness, learned how to prevent and recover from injuries, how to be systematic in my approach to it (making progress is much less exact than adding
        a 5 lb plate like to your benchpress), and a lot more.  I began training my friends or giving advice to the ones who were interested in it, too. I even
        gave a talk and demo on it for at my old work! <br />

            What this whole series of life events did for me was make me realize how fluid a healthy lifestyle can be. I thought of myself as a runner and
            figured that would be a life-long moniker. It forced me to reevaluate my fitness goals and how to achieve them.<br />
            I have so many more achievements to unlock in this sport. It seems like every time I learn something new, I barely give myself
            time to feel accomplished before I start working towards the next skill. Because lets be honest, I am just trying to fill my Tinder profile with these:<br />
