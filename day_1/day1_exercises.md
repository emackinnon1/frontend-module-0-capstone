## Chapter 1 and 2 questions

#### 1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?  
HTML provides structure and basic content to a website.  

#### 2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?  
The terms are used interchangeably but strictly speaking the element encompasses the opening tag, the content following it and the closing tag, while tags are just the previously-mentioned opening and closing tags.  

#### 3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?  
Attributes provide more information about the element in the form of a name and an associated value.  

#### 4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.  
The <body> tag is the main part of the page and what shows up in your browser. The <head> element contains information about the page like the title of the page. The contents of the title are shown in the top of the browser and can give you an idea of what the page contains.  

#### 5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?  
Right click on the webpage or element you'd like to look at and on the subsequent menu, click "Inspect".  

#### 6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.  
<h1> is for main headings.  
<b> indicates bold text.  
<blockquote> is used for long quotes that take up a whole paragraph.  
<br /> is the line break tag and is used to show a line break in the middle of a paragraph.  
<strong> elements indicates that this element's content has strong importance.  

#### 7. What are empty elements?  
Empty elements usually have only one tag that contains a slash before the closing angle bracket.  

#### 8. What is semantic markup?  
Semantic markup elements do not affect the structure of your web page, but they provide extra information to search engines and screen readers.  

#### 9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.  
<nav> contains the navigational blocks for the site, such as the links at the bottom of every webpage.  
<aside> can contain information that is related to an article but not essential to it.  It can also act as a container for information that is related to the whole page.  
<header> contains the header of the entire page or the header of individual articles on the page.
